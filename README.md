## Project Description:
This project is about RestoBAr Website , in which all information about RestoBar , and services at RestoBar . In this website i used parallex effect to show different photos of RestoBar in the website & made 4 container to get my parallex effect.I also created static nav bar or menu list at the top  Right of  website .I also add some form input , to get get from user , while this website is static once i improve or devlop more into it and javascript help me to do so.
During coding , I learn many things about this technologies i used in it, i.e. HTML & CSS. To create a parallex effect into website its very difficult for me once i  know things about it become soo easy for myself to add this effect in my project.

## Technologies Used:
I used two basic technology :
1 HTML : Html is used to create a static webpages , it is very easy to understand and helpful to build simple website .
2.CSS : Css is just add on HTML , CSS stands for CASCADING Style Sheet, which help to add various styling into our web page and also help us to do styling Externally.

Parallax Effect  is a scrolling technique used in computer graphics in which background images move more slowly than images in the foreground, creating the illusion of depth and immersion. It is often used in video games.
The word "parallax" is taken from astronomy and defined as the apparent displacement or the difference in apparent direction of something when viewed from two different vantage points.

In the world of digital graphics, programmers can achieve parallax scrolling in different ways. One involves creating different layers that move at uneven speeds when rendered in a browser or other viewer. Alternately, programmers can create "sprites," or independent parts of an image, often in the form of avatars or characters that move within a digital landscape. The cycling of repeating patterns is another technique that has been useful in many video game projects and other animations, and programmers can also manipulate the rendering of raster graphics or bitmapped visuals to create parallax scrolling.

In general, developers have to consider various elements to create a parallax scrolling effect with integrity and versatility. For example, one approach involves the creation of image layers through attribution, followed by assigning a scroll function and designating speeds for each item, then adding any HTML or CSS fixes for different browsers or viewers. As with other kinds of visual projects, incorporating the right syntax of the latest versions of these resources are crucial to developing a parallax scrolling technique that works well.
 
## Setup :
To setup you have to follow following steps :
### Step 1: Add your new site
Once you've logged in, it will take you to a home dashboard. Click the New site from git button to add your new website to Netlify.
### Step 2: Link to your GitHub
When you click the New site from git button, it will take you to the "Create a new site" page. Make sure that you push your repository on GitHub so that Netlify can link to your GitHub account.

### Step 3: Authorize Netlify
Next, click the Authorize Netlify by Netlify button. This permission is needed so that both Netlify and GitHub can connect.

### Step 4: Select your repository
Once you grant permission to Netlify, you can see a list of all your repositories. Select your website to publish. You can find it by either scrolling down the list or using the search bar to narrow down the list.
